# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The WTWT application previously only had front end accessibility, now using back end technologies , server side development node.js and express.js to create an express App, this allows the client and server to communicate via routes and controllers that take care of error handling. Using mongoose , a hot reload is enabled for developer use and mongo compass allows users to see data transfer between client and server in real time.
